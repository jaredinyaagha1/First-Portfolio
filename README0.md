# First-Portfolio

# Description
### This webpage is a practice version of my first portfolio as a Full Stack Web Developer using HTML and CSS. With this project, I am exercising my ability to create fully functional webpages from scratch. On this webpage I have included links and images to my featured projects, a small bio about myself and a section for contacting me, complete with an HTML form. Below is an image of what the webpage looks like upon the link.

# Process
### In order to begin this project, I spent some time figuring out what I features I wanted the webpage to contain. Since it is my first development from scratch, I decided to take a simple approach and just include what I felt a basic portfolio webpage would feature. It has a background, a title and navigation bar, a bio, a gallery of my featured projects, as well as a form for those who are interested in contacting me directly.

### I used a lorem ipsum generator to create placeholder text so that I can update it at a later date

#
### In my gallery I have included images of my featured projects and to demonstrate my grasp on CSS I used media queries to detect when the viewer hovers over the images in the gallery and enlargens them. The form for contacting me is created using HTM form element.
