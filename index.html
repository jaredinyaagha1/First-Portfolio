                I find your lack of faith disturbing. Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Don't be too
                proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant
                next to the power of the Force.
                All right. Well, take care of yourself, Han. I guess that's what you're best at, ain't it? You're all
                clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! You don't believe in the Force, do you? He is here.
                Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him.
                I don't know what you're talking about. I am a member of the Imperial Senate on a diplomatic mission to
                Alderaan-- As you wish. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight?
                She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it
                personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time! The plans you refer to will soon be back
                in our hands.
                A tremor in the Force. The last time I felt it was in the presence of my old master. Still, she's got a
                lot of spirit. I don't know, what do you think? What good is a reward if you ain't around to use it?
                Besides, attacking that battle station ain't my idea of courage. It's more like…suicide.
                I find your lack of faith disturbing. What?! I suggest you try it again, Luke. This time, let go your
                conscious self and act on instinct. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home!
            </p>

                Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as "Smoke Yourself Thin" and "Get
                Some Confidence, Stupid!" Donuts. Is there anything they can't do? Oh, a *sarcasm* detector. Oh, that's
                a *really* useful invention!
                Facts are meaningless. You could use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true! Oh, a *sarcasm*
                detector. Oh, that's a *really* useful invention! I prefer a vehicle that doesn't hurt Mother Earth.
                It's a go-cart, powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction.
                Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos. Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair
                city! He is the cancer and I am the…uh…what cures cancer? Marge, just about everything's a sin. Y'ever
                sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not supposed to go to the bathroom.
                Duffman can't breathe! OH NO! Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix. Your guilty
                consciences may make you vote Democratic, but secretly you all yearn for a Republican president to lower
                taxes, brutalize criminals, and rule you like a king!
                And here I am using my own lungs like a sucker.
